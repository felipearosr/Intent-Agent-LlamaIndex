# Intent detection with agent in LlamaIndex

In this tutorial, we will explore how to implement a intent detection agent. This agent aims to reduce the cost of retrieving answers from vector store. Sending irrelevant queries to a cheaper model that doesnt access the vector store.

This notebook is based in one of my [projects](https://github.com/felipearosr/RAG-LlamaIndex/tree/main/5.Intent%20Detection%20Agent). There you can find an implemention with chainlit.
